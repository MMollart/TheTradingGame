## 💪 How to Produce (Challenge System)

1. **Request Challenge** → Click "📋 Request Challenge" for a building
2. **Receive Challenge** → Banker assigns exercise (push-ups, burpees, etc.)
3. **Complete It** → Do the exercise within 10 minutes
4. **Get Resources** → Production happens automatically!

**Without School:** One challenge at a time for whole team (team-wide lock)  
**With School:** Each member can have own challenge simultaneously ✅ *BUILD THIS FIRST!*

**Common Challenges:** 20 push-ups, 30 sit-ups, 15 burpees, 25 star jumps, 20 squats

## 💱 Trading

### With World Bank
- Prices change based on supply/demand (check the chart!)
- Buy low, sell high
- 10% spread: Buy price > Sell price

### With Other Teams
1. Create offer (what you give + what you want)
2. Other team accepts, rejects, or counters
3. Resources transfer instantly on acceptance

**Strategy:** Trade your abundant resources for what you need!

---

## 🍖 Food Tax (Critical!)

**Every 15 minutes:** Nations must pay food tax to World Bank
- **Can't pay?** → **FAMINE** → Pay **2× the tax amount in currency** instead!
- **Example:** Can't pay 15 food → Must pay 30 currency (devastating!)

**Keep 30+ food at all times to avoid famine!**

**Restaurants help:** Each restaurant earns 5₵ per food taxed (e.g., 2 restaurants + 15 tax = 150₵)

---

## 🏆 Scoring (How to Win)

**Final Score = Resources + Buildings + Trade + Kindness**

- **Resources:** Valued at current bank prices
- **Buildings:** Worth 2× their currency cost
- **Trade:** Profit from smart deals
- **Kindness:** Optional - helping other nations

**Two Paths to Victory:**
1. **Financial Winner**: Most total points
2. **Kindest Nation**: Most generous to others
