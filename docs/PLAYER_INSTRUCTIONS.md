## 💪 Physical Challenges

### How Challenges Work

Production in The Trading Game is gated by physical challenges. To produce resources, you must complete real-world exercises!

### Challenge Process

1. **Request a Challenge**
   - Click "📋 Request Challenge" for the building you want to use
   - Your request goes to the Banker/Host

2. **Challenge Assignment**
   - Banker/Host selects a challenge type (push-ups, burpees, etc.)
   - You receive the challenge description (e.g., "20 Push-ups")
   - You have 10 minutes of active game time to complete it

3. **Complete the Challenge**
   - Perform the physical exercise
   - Click "✓ Complete Challenge" when done
   - Resources are produced immediately!

4. **Challenge Expires**
   - If not completed within 10 minutes, the challenge expires
   - You can request a new challenge

### Challenge Types

Common challenges include:
- **Push-ups**: Usually 20 reps
- **Sit-ups**: Usually 30 reps
- **Burpees**: Usually 15 reps
- **Star Jumps**: Usually 25 reps
- **Squats**: Usually 20 reps

*Note: The Banker can adjust these targets to match player fitness levels.*

### Challenge Locking

**Without a School:**
- Only one challenge can be active for your entire team at a time
- Team members must wait for others to complete challenges
- Slower but doesn't require School building

**With a School:**
- Each team member can have their own active challenge
- Multiple members can produce simultaneously
- Faster production and better efficiency!

### Pause-Aware Timing

**Important**: Challenge timers pause when the game is paused!
- You always get a full 10 minutes of active gameplay
- Pauses don't count against your challenge time
- Fair timing for all players

## 🏭 Production

### How to Produce Resources

1. **Ensure you have the building** (e.g., Farm, Mine, Factory)
2. **Check input requirements** (Factories need raw materials/food)
3. **Request a challenge** for that building type
4. **Complete the physical challenge** within 10 minutes
5. **Receive your resources** automatically!

### Production Amounts

Each successful challenge produces:
- **Farm**: 5 Food
- **Mine**: 5 Raw Materials
- **Electrical Factory**: 5 Electrical Goods (requires 5 Raw Materials)
- **Medical Factory**: 5 Medical Goods (requires 5 Food)

### Production Multipliers

The more buildings you have, the more you produce per challenge!
- 1 Farm = 5 Food per challenge
- 2 Farms = 10 Food per challenge
- 3 Farms = 15 Food per challenge
- And so on...

**Strategy Tip**: Build multiple production buildings to maximize output!

## 🍖 Food Tax & Penalties

### Food Tax System

Every 15 minutes, nations must pay food tax to the World Bank:

- **Developed Nations** (Nations 1 & 2): 15 Food
- **Developing Nations** (Nations 3 & 4): 5 Food

**Important**: Building a School increases your food tax! Plan accordingly.

### Paying Food Tax

Food tax is typically collected automatically:
- Resources are deducted from your nation's food supply
- You'll see a notification when tax is collected
- Keep adequate food stocks to avoid penalties!

### Famine Penalty

**If you cannot pay the food tax:**

1. **Famine** is declared for your nation
2. You must pay **double the food tax amount in currency** to the bank
3. Example: Developed nation can't pay 15 food → must pay 30 currency
4. This penalty can devastate your economy!

**How to Avoid Famine:**
- Always maintain a food reserve (at least 30 food recommended)
- Build Farms to produce food
- Trade for food with other nations or the bank
- Monitor your food levels constantly

### Restaurant Benefits

Restaurants turn food tax into profit!
- Each restaurant generates **5 currency per food unit taxed**
- Formula: `food_tax × 5 × number_of_restaurants`
- Example: 2 restaurants + 15 food tax = 150 currency earned!
- Restaurants don't help during famine (must pay tax first)
